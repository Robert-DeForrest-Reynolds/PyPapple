"""
minimal implementation requirements:
 - the syntax in full implementation
 - the language should feel like it will when written in full using C
 - thought-through implementation of error handling
 - a LSP for vscode so the language can actually be used

what does not need to be in the language:
 - standard library implementations Python already handles (string manipulation, packing/unpacking or structuring/destructuring, etc.)
 - quality of life implementations that are not paramount to the fundamental developer workflow
 - anything not really in the tech_doc.md
